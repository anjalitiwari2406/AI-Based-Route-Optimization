# AI-Based Route Optimization

## Overview
This project presents an AI-driven route optimization system to address urban traffic management challenges. The system integrates geospatial data, machine learning models, and network optimization to provide accurate travel time predictions and efficient routing solutions.

## Features
- **Geospatial Data Processing**: Utilizes OpenStreetMap for location and road network data.
- **Machine Learning Prediction**: Implements a Random Forest regression model to estimate travel times.
- **Route Visualization**: Interactive maps with color-coded routes for easy interpretation.
- **Network Optimization**: Uses OSMnx and NetworkX for shortest path calculations.
- **Scalable System**: Can be adapted for different cities and real-time traffic integration.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
  - OSMnx, NetworkX (Network Analysis)
  - Folium, Matplotlib (Visualization)
  
## Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn osmnx networkx folium matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-route-optimization.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd ai-route-optimization
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Dataset
The system processes geospatial data including:
- Locations and road networks from OpenStreetMap
- Distance calculations using the Haversine formula
- Simulated travel time variations for real-world emulation

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures clustering effectiveness
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Evaluates cluster separation
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: Assesses variance ratio

## Results & Insights
- Predicts travel times with high accuracy
- Provides optimized routes to reduce congestion
- Enables data-driven traffic planning and decision-making

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time traffic data
- Support for multimodal transportation (buses, trains, etc.)
- Mobile and web-based application for real-time route suggestions
